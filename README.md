# AdapterHomework
As a practice for the adapter pattern, this is a modification of a given system. The system originally modified the ItemIcon class to accept ListItems, but that doesn't fit the adapter design pattern. To fit it into the pattern, I created a ListItemIconAdapter class. Additionally, the sort button was given functionality and a field for adding extra values was added.
